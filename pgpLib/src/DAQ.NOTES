Much of this code comes from the DAQ, albeit with a few modifications:
    - The constructor for Pgp used to take a file descriptor, now it 
      takes the port/lane information and opens the file itself.
    - The static _fd and _portOffset fields were removed from
      RegisterSlaveExportFrame.  Now, the Pgp class is passed in, permitting
      more than one open Pgp card at a time.
